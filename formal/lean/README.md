# CON²PHYS Lean 4 formal mathematics

Pinned Lean: `leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0`.
Pinned Mathlib: `5ed2965256430c3649e86755f9576b54eca72435` (Mathlib v4.34.0).

```sh
cd formal/lean

lake build
lake env lean Con2physFormal/Logic.lean
```

The pilot corresponds to the **logic chapter** of `books/formal_foundations`.
It contains five declarations for De Morgan laws, contraposition and quantifier
negation. All five passed the Lean kernel check in [this GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/ze-gois/paper_con2phys/actions/runs/38179132288); the [proof registry](../../../mathematics/formal_registry.json) records each declaration and its axioms.

`#print axioms` reports underlying axiomatic assumptions; these are
different from source imports and tactics. The proof scripts contain no
`sorry`, `admit` or new `axiom` declarations.

All other results are pending a matching formalization. The automated
inventory is intentionally a *syntactic first pass* and does not claim to
identify every implicit theorem in ordinary text.
