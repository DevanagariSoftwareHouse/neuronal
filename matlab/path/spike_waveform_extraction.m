function [waves,kept] = spike_waveform_extraction(recording,indices,before,after)
%SPIKE_WAVEFORM_EXTRACTION Event-aligned AP snippets from multichannel data.
% Input recording=channels x samples, indices=MATLAB one-based sample indices.
% Output spikes x channels x waveform_samples. NOT for downsampled LFP.
%
%   SIGNATURE DESCRIPTION
%     recording — multichannel recording matrix; channel/sample orientation is stated above.
%     indices — the indices value; expected shape, units, and constraints are stated in the notes above.
%     before — the before value; expected shape, units, and constraints are stated in the notes above.
%     after — the after value; expected shape, units, and constraints are stated in the notes above.
%   RETURNS
%     waves — the returned value; see the summary above for meaning and units.
%     kept — the returned value; see the summary above for meaning and units.
%   USAGE EXAMPLE
%     % Prepare the input variables above with the documented dimensions and units.
%     [waves, kept] = spike_waveform_extraction(recording, indices, before, after);
